# Data Science Practise

This is a project showing my baby steps to learn data science

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Python3.6
* Anaconda
* sqlite 3 library to read the sql data
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* sklearn.cluster
* sklearn.preprocessing
* customplot*



### Installing

After installing anaconda succesufully run the command anaconda-navigator and launch jupyter notebook
Some of the libraries are third parties hence you'll need **pip** or **conda** to install them
note* customplot is a python file containing customized functions

For example;

```
pip install numpy
```





## Running the tests

## Deployment
Not ready for deployment yet
## Built With

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/ ) - a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
